### Data Domain Model

The data architecture is organized around key domain entities that represent the core concepts in building management:

#### Core Entities

- **Building**: Physical structures managed by the system
- **Space**: Defined areas within buildings (floors, rooms, zones)
- **Asset**: Equipment and systems within buildings
- **Sensor**: Devices that collect data from the environment
- **User**: Individuals who interact with the system
- **Organization**: Companies and departments that own or manage buildings
- **Event**: Occurrences of interest (alerts, maintenance activities, etc.)
- **Measurement**: Data points collected from sensors and systems

#### Entity Relationships

The relationships between these entities form the foundation of the data model:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Organization ||--o{ Building : owns
    Building ||--o{ Space : contains
    Building ||--o{ Asset : houses
    Space ||--o{ Asset : contains
    Asset ||--o{ Sensor : has
    Asset ||--o{ Maintenance : requires
    Sensor ||--o{ Measurement : produces
    User }|--o{ Organization : belongs_to
    User }|--o{ Role : has
    Role }|--o{ Permission : includes
    Event }o--|| Asset : affects
    Event }o--|| Space : occurs_in
    Event }o--|| User : involves
    Measurement }|--|| Sensor : from
    Measurement }|--|| Parameter : measures
