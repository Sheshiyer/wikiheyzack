### Brand Narrative

HeyZack was born from a simple observation: buildings are getting smarter, but managing them is getting more complex. Our founders, with backgrounds in building automation and software development, saw an opportunity to simplify building management while maximizing efficiency.

We believe that every building has untapped potential. By connecting systems, analyzing data, and automating controls, we help unlock that potential, creating spaces that are more efficient, sustainable, and comfortable.

Our journey began with a focus on commercial buildings, where the need for intelligent management was most acute. Today, we're expanding our vision to include residential properties, bringing the benefits of smart building technology to a wider audience.

At HeyZack, we're not just building technology; we're building a future where buildings work better for people and the planet.
