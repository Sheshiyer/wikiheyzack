# HeyZack Burn Rate

## Overview

Burn rate represents the rate at which HeyZack is spending its cash reserves over a specific period. It is a critical metric for assessing the company's financial runway and the need for future funding.

## Key Components/Elements

1.  **Cash Flow:**
    -   Track all cash inflows (e.g., revenue, investments) and outflows (e.g., operating expenses, capital expenditures).
    -   Focus on the net cash flow, which is the difference between cash inflows and outflows.
2.  **Calculation:**
    -   **Formula:** Burn Rate = Net Cash Outflow per Month (or other time period)
    -   **Gross Burn Rate:** Total cash spent in a period.
    -   **Net Burn Rate:** Total cash spent minus revenue in a period.
3.  **Time Period:**
    -   Calculate burn rate over a specific time period (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
    -   Choose a time period that aligns with HeyZack's financial reporting cycles.

## Measurement & Analysis

-   **Monthly Tracking:** Track burn rate monthly to monitor cash flow.
-   **Trend Analysis:** Analyze burn rate trends over time to identify areas for improvement.
-   **Runway Calculation:** Calculate the runway (the amount of time HeyZack can continue to operate at its current burn rate)
-   **Scenario Planning:** Model different burn rate scenarios to assess the impact on runway.

## Best Practices

-   **Accuracy:** Accurately track and categorize all cash inflows and outflows.
-   **Transparency:** Clearly state the assumptions and data sources used to calculate burn rate.
-   **Optimization:** Continuously optimize spending to reduce burn rate.
-   **Proactive Planning:** Plan for future funding rounds based on burn rate and runway.

## HeyZack-Specific Application

-   HeyZack's burn rate is calculated as follows:
    -   Total Monthly Expenses: \$300,000
    -   Total Monthly Revenue: \$250,050 (from MRR)
    -   Net Burn Rate = \$300,000 - \$250,050 = \$49,950 per month
    -   Cash on Hand: \$1,000,000
    -   Runway = \$1,000,000 / \$49,950 = ~20 months
    -   Target Burn Rate: Reduce net burn rate to \$20,000 per month within the next 6 months.
