# HeyZack Churn Rate

## Overview

Churn rate represents the percentage of customers who cancel their subscriptions or stop using HeyZack's products or services within a specific period. It is a critical metric for assessing customer retention and the long-term sustainability of the business.

## Key Components/Elements

1.  **Customer Definition:**
    -   Define what constitutes a "churned" customer (e.g., cancelled subscription, non-renewal).
    -   Consider the specific criteria for defining churn based on HeyZack's business model.
2.  **Time Period:**
    -   Calculate churn rate over a specific time period (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually).
    -   Choose a time period that aligns with HeyZack's subscription cycles.
3.  **Calculation:**
    -   **Formula:** Churn Rate = (Number of Customers Churned During Period / Number of Customers at the Beginning of Period) \* 100
    -   **Example:** If 10 customers churned in a month and there were 100 customers at the beginning of the month, the churn rate is (10 / 100) \* 100 = 10%.
4.  **Customer Segmentation:**
    -   Segment churn rate by customer segment (e.g., building type, geographic region, subscription tier).
    -   Analyze churn rates for different customer groups to identify patterns and drivers.

## Measurement & Analysis

-   **Monthly Tracking:** Track churn rate monthly to monitor customer retention.
-   **Trend Analysis:** Analyze churn rate trends over time to identify areas for improvement.
-   **Cohort Analysis:** Analyze churn rates for different customer cohorts to identify trends.
-   **Churn Drivers:** Identify the reasons why customers are churning (e.g., pricing, product issues, customer support).

## Best Practices

-   **Accuracy:** Accurately track and calculate churn rate.
-   **Proactive Measures:** Implement proactive measures to reduce churn (e.g., customer onboarding, customer support, product improvements).
-   **Customer Feedback:** Gather feedback from churned customers to understand the reasons for churn.
-   **Targeted Retention:** Develop targeted retention strategies for different customer segments.

## HeyZack-Specific Application

-   HeyZack's churn rate is calculated as follows:
    -   Customers at the beginning of the month: 100
    -   Customers churned during the month: 5
    -   Churn Rate = (5 / 100) \* 100 = 5% per month
    -   Target Churn Rate: 3% or less per month.
