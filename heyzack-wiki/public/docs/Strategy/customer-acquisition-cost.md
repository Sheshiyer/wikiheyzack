## HeyZack-Specific Application

-   HeyZack's CAC is calculated as follows:

    -   Total Sales Costs (per year): \$750,000
    -   Number of New Customers Acquired (per year): 250
    -   CAC = (\$500,000 + \$750,000) / 250 = \$5,000 per customer
    -   Target CAC: \$4,000 or less per customer.
