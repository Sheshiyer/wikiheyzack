Key Points
Research suggests major companies like Schneider Electric, Siemens, Johnson Controls, Honeywell, and Equans offer IoT-enabled building management systems aligned with NF EN ISO 52120-1:2022 and compliant with BAT TH 116 gtb France for energy-saving certificates (CEE).
These systems, such as EcoStruxure Building, Desigo, OpenBlue, and Honeywell’s Building Management System, are designed to enhance energy efficiency and can achieve required performance classes.
It seems likely that French-specific companies like Equans also provide compliant solutions, given their market presence.
Overview
Building management systems (BMS) with IoT capabilities allow remote monitoring and control of building functions like heating, ventilation, and lighting, improving energy efficiency. The NF EN ISO 52120-1:2022 standard, effective since 2022, sets guidelines for energy performance, categorizing systems into classes (A, B, C, D) based on efficiency. BAT TH 116 gtb France, likely a typo for BAT TH 116, is a French standard for installing GTB systems to generate CEE, requiring class B or A for heating and domestic hot water.
Recommended Companies
Research suggests the following companies are suitable:  
Schneider Electric with EcoStruxure Building (Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Building)  
Siemens with Desigo (Siemens Desigo Building Automation)  
Johnson Controls with OpenBlue (Johnson Controls OpenBlue)  
Honeywell with Building Management System (Honeywell Building Management Systems)  
French company Equans, known for BMS and CEE compliance (Equans Building Management System).
Unexpected Detail
An interesting aspect is the rapid adoption of these standards in France, driven by regulations like Eco-énergie Tertiaire and RE2020, creating a competitive market where smaller French companies also play a role, though specific compliance details may vary.
Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of IoT-Enabled Building Management Systems Aligned with Standards
This note provides a comprehensive examination of building management systems (BMS) that are IoT-enabled, aligned with the NF EN ISO 52120-1:2022 standard, and compliant with BAT TH 116 gtb France, likely referring to BAT TH 116, a French regulation for energy-saving certificates (CEE). The analysis draws on available information to ensure a thorough understanding for stakeholders in building management and energy efficiency.
Background on Building Management Systems and IoT
Building management systems are centralized control systems used to monitor and manage mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical services in buildings, such as HVAC, lighting, and security. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology enhances these systems by enabling real-time data collection, remote control, and predictive maintenance, improving energy efficiency and operational costs. IoT-enabled BMS, as discussed in resources like Robustel’s IoT Solutions for BMS, leverage connected devices for smarter building management, applicable across various sectors including commercial and residential buildings.
NF EN ISO 52120-1:2022 Standard
The NF EN ISO 52120-1:2022 standard, published in March 2022, focuses on the energy performance of buildings, specifically the contribution of building automation, controls, and management systems. It replaces the previous NF EN 15232-1:2017 and is referenced in the European Union Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). The standard specifies:  
A structured list of control, automation, and technical management functions contributing to energy performance, categorized by building disciplines and building automation and control (BAC).  
Methods to define minimum requirements for energy efficiency, applicable to buildings of varying complexity.  
Factor-based and detailed methods to estimate the impact of these functions on energy consumption.
It introduces four performance classes (A, B, C, D), with class A being the most energy-efficient, as outlined in Sinteo’s Class A BMS Guide. For example, a class A BMS uses sensors for data collection to optimize energy consumption, ideal for high-performance buildings.
BAT TH 116 gtb France and Compliance
BAT TH 116, as detailed in France Energies’ BAT TH 116 Page, is a standardized operation sheet for installing GTB systems in tertiary buildings to generate CEE, part of France’s energy efficiency program. It requires the GTB system to ensure functions of class B or A as per NF EN ISO 52120-1:2022 for heating and domestic hot water, and potentially other uses like cooling and lighting, especially in overseas regions. The system must be installed by a professional, with coefficients applied based on climatic zones (e.g., 1.1 for zone H1, 0.9 for H2, 0.6 for H3) to calculate energy savings.  
Given the reference to “gtb France,” it seems likely a typo for BAT TH 116, aligning with French energy regulations. Compliance involves meeting these class requirements and documentation for CEE eligibility, as seen in Hellio’s BAT TH 116 FAQ.
