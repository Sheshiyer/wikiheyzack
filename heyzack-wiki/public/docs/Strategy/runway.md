# HeyZack Runway

## Overview

Runway represents the estimated amount of time HeyZack can continue to operate at its current burn rate, based on its available cash reserves. It is a critical metric for assessing the company's financial stability and the need for future funding.

## Key Components/Elements

1.  **Cash on Hand:**
    -   Determine the total amount of cash and cash equivalents available.
    -   Include cash in bank accounts, short-term investments, and other liquid assets.
2.  **Burn Rate:**
    -   Calculate the net burn rate (cash outflow minus revenue) over a specific period (e.g., monthly).
    -   Use the most recent burn rate data.
3.  **Calculation:**
    -   **Formula:** Runway = Cash on Hand / Burn Rate
    -   **Time Unit:** The result will be in the same time unit as the burn rate (e.g., months).

## Measurement & Analysis

-   **Monthly Tracking:** Track runway monthly to monitor financial stability.
-   **Trend Analysis:** Analyze runway trends over time to identify areas for improvement.
-   **Scenario Planning:** Model different burn rate scenarios to assess the impact on runway.
-   **Funding Planning:** Use runway to plan for future funding rounds.

## Best Practices

-   **Accuracy:** Accurately track cash on hand and burn rate.
-   **Regular Updates:** Update runway regularly to reflect changes in cash flow.
-   **Proactive Planning:** Plan for future funding rounds well in advance of running out of cash.
-   **Contingency Planning:** Develop contingency plans to extend runway if needed.

## HeyZack-Specific Application

-   HeyZack's runway is calculated as follows:
    -   Cash on Hand: \$1,000,000
    -   Net Burn Rate: \$49,950 per month (from burn-rate.md)
    -   Runway = \$1,000,000 / \$49,950 = ~20 months
    -   Target Runway: Maintain a runway of at least 18 months.
